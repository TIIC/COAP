This package implements a baseline approach for service reliability prediction 
by using the average values of historical data.

Usage of this package
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For ease of reproducing and compare with other approaches, we provide the 
detailed experimental results with several metrics (e.g., MAE, NMAE, RMSE), 
under the "result/" directory, after running the above QoS prediction approach 
on our dataset. E.g.,"result/avg_relResult_0.02.txt" records the evaluation 
results under matrix density = 2%. In particular, each experiment is run for 
20 times and the average result (including std value) is reported. These 
results can be directly used for your research work.

On the other hand, if you want to reproduce our experiments, you can run the 
program with our provided Python scripts "run_rel.py" and "run_rt.py". You can 
also turn on the "parallelMode" in the config area for speedup if you use a 
multi-core computer.

>> python run_rel.py
>> python run_rt.py
